# Wearwise
Build a two way marketplace web application. Here's how it works.

Fashion retails (wearables products like shirts and shoes) enroll their product in this website or a scraper scrapes trending products from amazon/flipkart.

Website lists all products and a CTA to try out. Each user has limited tokens. They can use the tokens to try the wearable using AI. They upload a picture and AI generates an image of them wearing the product.

- Wishlist
- Wardrobe
- Different poses, perspectives and environments
- Share on social media

It's a good implementation and marketing that matters here. The idea is good imo.

Dropping project - AI is expensive :(
